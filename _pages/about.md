Hello, my name is Fadul Sikder. I am a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the University of Texas at Arlington. Currently, I am working under the supervision of Dr. Jeff Lei at Software Engineering Research Group.

My research interests are situated in the sphere of Blockchain, Smart Contract, and the security and trustability implications of those technologies. Currently, I am researching to apply traditional software analysis techniques like symbolic execution and fuzzing to create new tools and approaches for testing Smart Contracts on different Blockchain platforms like Ethereum, Cardona, Solana, etc.
