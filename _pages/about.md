Hello, my name is Fadul Sikderd. I am a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the University of Texas at Arlington. Currently, I am working under the supervision of Dr. Jeff Lei at Software Engineering Research Group.

My research interests are in the intersection of Software Engineering and Web3, focusing on the security analysis of the blockchain and smart contracts.
